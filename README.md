# Key Points

1. Intro

Hi everyone, So my self Gokul R Nair a Computer Science student from India as well as a iOS App Developer and a freelancer . So its been almost 2 years I am into iOS App development. So just to give you a brief intro about my first hands on with swift and Xcode it was when a club from my universiy conducted an event called iOS Fusion. To be rally frank i dint even knew whats the evnet about, just because it had iOS in the name i went there. Even i remember during those days i even didnt had an MacBook and i borrowed my roommates mac to particimate in the event. The event was for 3 days and i must say from that day till now its been hardly any day i have not worked on swift. I just really got in love with the swift language. And i feel you all can corelate, the words like performSegue, DispatchQueue IBOutlets, IBActions, weak var, extension..and many more, all this words become an part of my life. 

2. How I started ?

So being an iOS App developer and a student people usually ask me how i started with swift, so if you would ask me then for me it was the event i mentioed before, but for students who dont have such events for them what i would suggest is get an course from any of the reputed edcutaional site. In my case i took the course of Angela Yu from udemy. Why i am suggesting to get an course is, courses usually make you eager to learn new chapters, if you would randomly search on Youtube or anywhere the flow wont be consistent so getting a course is highly prefferable. Once you feel you are able to make basic apps then you can go on with learning random videos, reading blogs, refering stackoverflow and etc. In the begiing itself if you would start with blogs and all you wont understand it properly and atlast you would end with copng codes. So its better to start with courses later on with blogs and random videos.

3. Project Experience

Now lets talk a lil about projects. Being a developer you must always try on making new things. Developing new stuffs would make you learn various new topics. In my two years of iOS app dev i have worked on 70+ small as well as major projetcs. Making projects made me to learn various new topics. What i would tell you is once you learn anew topic try to inculcate it in any of your project. Similarly when you go on learning new stuffs add those things in your ptoject and by this way you will make you core more stronger. Projects can be really small and really big it, but at last what you need is your concepts must be clear. So this will be my suggestions on project.

4. How i got into helping my club!

So right now i am part of a club in my university called Apple Developers Group. So the event i mentioned before was conducted by this club only. So what happened is few days after that event the club held their annual recruitment. So i was really eager to be a part of that club and some how i managed to get into that club. So basically we at Apple Developers Group focus on imparting new technical stuffs to students who are eager to learn. We have tea of almost 7 iOS developer and almost 10-12 junior developers. We takewekly sessions and teach new stuffs regarding iOS App Dev and etc.

Under that club i have made two apps one was a Recruitment Portal App where student can give their tests and another was a question paper bank portal limited to our university.

5. Freelancing Journey

Lets get a lil bit into my freelancing journey.
In my journey of iOS app dev i have made apps for 2-3 companies as a freelancer. Being a student getting an freelancing job is really hard. I have seen my friend working really hard to get a freelancing work. So i my case what worked was two most important things.
     
A. Networing 
As we all know networing is realy imortant hwne you are in field if computer science. Networking with new peole really heps you to get new projetcs. So two of my freelancing work i got was due to my networks. Always try to connect with new people of your domain. Not oly in lure of projects but also to learn new stuffs.

In my case i can give you a live example, So it was a noon hour when i was randomly going through app store and found agame called Sf Symbols and i used it and to be frank i found something missing in it. Just to check is that an pen source game i searched it on github and i was luck to find that it was an Open Source Project. Within seconds i forked the repo added a small feature which was haptic feedback and made a PR. And my PR was accepted within minutes and i was a successful contributor in that app . The main twist in that is the app which i am talking about was made by Rudrank with whom you just had a talk. After that i started following Rudrank and his blogs, must say they are really informative. Evem i have contacted him to get suggesting about one of my prject. 

So ya what i want to say i make  your networks strong, that would always help you to develop yourself as a developer and you can alway leran new stuffs from the community.

B. Github
Make you github profile as ggod as possible and always try to make os contribution. In my case one of my freelancing work i got was due to my Github Profile and projects which i had. Always try to add your each ad every whether be small or big into github, you never know there are chances that someone would like your small projects too.

So ya thses two things worked atleast for me to get freelancing works. Other than that what you can do is write blogs, help people on stackoverflow this things too works.

Justtry you best in which domain among the ones i told and give your best shot.
