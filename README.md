# Key Points

# 1. Intro

Hi everyone, So my self Gokul R Nair a Computer Science student from India as well as an iOS App Developer and a freelancer . Hope so you all are fine and enjoying the sessions.

So its been almost 2 years I am into iOS App development. Worked on various projects, learned new stuffs..etc. So just to give you a brief intro about my first hands on with swift and Xcode it was when a club from my university conducted an event called iOS Fusion. To be rally frank i didn’t even knew whats the event all about, just because it had iOS in the name i went there, being a 18 year old it really fascinated me. Even i remember during those days i even didn't had a MacBook, so i borrowed my roommates mac to participate in the event. The event was for 3 days and i must say from that day till now its been hardly any day i have not worked on swift. I just really got in love with the swift language. And i feel you all can correlate the same; words like performSegue, DispatchQueue IBOutlets, IBActions, weak var, extension..and many more, all this words become a part of my life.

# 2. How I started ?

So being an iOS App developer and a student people usually ask me how i started with swift, so if you would ask me then for me it was the event i mentioned before, but for students who don’t have such events for them what i would suggest is get a course from any of the reputed educational site. In my case i took the course of Angela Yu from udemy which I guess most of you might have took. Why i am suggesting to get a course is, courses usually make you eager to learn new chapters, if you would randomly search on Youtube or anywhere the flow wont be consistent so getting a course is highly preferable. Other than hat courses include basics of swift which is quite important once you start App Dev. Because it’s not always about using pre written protocols and functions which swift provide sometimes you need to use the basic knowledge to develop projects. For eg: appending a json parsed object to an array of stain you need to know the basics, because in such conditions you need to create a for loop then append elements one by one. This is one, but there are various such cases when you require the basics. Once you feel you are able to make basic apps then you can go on with learning with random videos, reading blogs, referring stack overflow and etc. In the beginning itself if you would start with blogs and all you wont understand it properly and at-last you would end up with coping codes. So it’s better to start with courses later on with blogs and random videos.

# 3. Project Experience

Now let’s talk a lil about projects. Being a developer you must always try on making new things. Developing new stuffs would make you learn various new topics. In my two years of iOS app dev i have worked on 70+ small as well as major projects. Making projects made me to learn various new topics. What i would tell you is once you learn a new topic try to inculcate it in any of your project. Similarly when you go on learning new stuffs add those things in your project and by this way you will make you core more stronger. Projects can be really small and really big it, but at last what you need is your concepts must be clear. So this will be my suggestions on project.

# 4. How i got into helping my club!

So right now i am part of a club in my university called Apple Developers Group. So the event i mentioned before was conducted by this club only. So what happened is few days after that event the club held their annual recruitment. So i was really eager to be a part of that club and some how i managed to get into that club. So basically we at Apple Developers Group focus on imparting new technical stuffs to students who are eager to learn. We have tea of almost 7 iOS developer and almost 10-12 junior developers. We take weekly sessions and teach new stuffs regarding iOS App Dev and etc.
Under that club i have made two apps one was a Recruitment Portal App where student can give their tests and another was a question paper bank portal limited to our university.

Being in that club I have really learned new things, especially networking with new people, imparting knowledge, real world project experience and many more.

So if you have any club whether in your university or anywhere, be it technical or non technical just try to get into there, because clubs give you a small perception of real world scenarios which we are gone a face in future. We can consider it as a miniature of real world.  So far this was my experience being in the club.


# 5. Freelancing Journey

Let’s get a lil bit into my freelancing journey. In my journey of iOS app dev i have made apps for 2-3 companies as a freelancer. Being a student getting a freelancing job is really hard. I have seen my friends working really hard to get a freelancing work still they don’t. So in my case what worked were these two most important things.

a. Networking

b. Github + Projects



## A. Networing 

As we all know networking is really important when you are in field if computer science. Networking with new people really helps you to get new projects. So two of my freelancing work i got was due to my networks. Always try to connect with new people of your domain. Not only in lure of projects but also to learn new stuffs.
In my case i can give you a live example, So it was a noon hour when i was randomly going through app store and found a game called Sf Symbols and i used it and to be frank i found something missing in it. Just to check is that an open source game I searched the developer’s name on Github, went through his repositories and I was lucky to find, that it was an Open Source Project. Within seconds I forked the repo added a small feature which I felt it was missing (i.e haptic feedback) and made a PR. And my PR was accepted within minutes and i was a successful contributor in that app . The twist over here is the app which i am talking about was Developed by Rudrank with whom you just had a talk. After that i started following Rudrank and his blogs, must say they are really informative. Even i have contacted him to get suggesting about one of my framework in swift. See, how cool networking is, Just a small contributions helped me to learn new thing and to get great suggestions.

So ya what i want to say is make your network strong, that would always help you to develop yourself as a developer and you can alway learn new stuffs from the community.

## B. Github 

Make your Github profile as god as possible and always try to make open source contribution. In my case one of my freelancing work i got was due to my Github Profile and projects which i had. Always try to add your projects whether be small or big on Github, you never know there are chances that someone would like your that one project which you ignored.

So ya these two things worked at-least for me to get freelancing works. Other than that what you can do is write blogs, help people on stackoverflow this things too works.

Just try you best in which domain among the ones i told and give your best shot.

# 6. How to keep your interest always on!
I always get a question about how to maintain your interest into a domain. So what i wold suggest is keep on learning new stuffs, when you get stoped at any point don’t leave it, take it as a challenge, but that doest mean you spend hours on solving it. Sometimes what happens is you will get burned out by revolving around the same bug/issue, at those time what you can do is, get relaxed, do something you enjoy,  then try to work on it again and i am sure you will be able to get it . This is what i follow.

So ya this is my journey of being an iOS App Developer and what I am, you can always contact me to get your doubts solved or any suggestions, or to talk about new technologies, ping me on twitter @itisGokulNair. Thank you, it was great talking to you people, sharing my experience hop so you loved and correlated it.
