1. Intro

Hi everyone, So my self Gokul R Nair a Computer Science student from India as well as a junior iOS App Developer. So its been almost 2 years I am into iOS App development. So just to give you a brief intro about my first hands on with swift and Xcode it was when a club from my universiy conducted an event called iOS Fusion. To be rally frank i dint even knew whats the evnet about, just because it had iOS in the name i went there. Even i remember during those days i even didnt had an MacBook and i borrowed my roommates mac to particimate in the event. The event was for 3 days and i must say from that day till now its been hardly any day i have not worked on swift. I just really got in love with the swift language. And i feel you all can corelate, the words like performSegue, DispatchQueue IBOutlets, IBActions, weak var, extension..and many more, all this words become an part of my life. 

2. How I started ?

So being an iOS App developer and a student people usually ask me how i started with swift, so if you would ask me then for me it was the event i mentioed before, but for students who dont have such events for them what i would suggest is get an course from any of the reputed edcutaional site. In my case i took the course of Angela Yu from udemy. Why i am suggesting to get an course is, courses usually make you eager to learn new chapters, if you would andomly search on Youtube or anywhere the flow wont be consistent so getting a course is highly prefferable. 

Other than that YouTube is also there, now a days we have really good content creatore who make videos on iOS App Dev
